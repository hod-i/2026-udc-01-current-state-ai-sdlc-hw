  e.g. /libraries/combo-box.
- Place project-specific components in "components/" folder, 
  e.g. /components/game-score-tracker.
- Use type inference where intent is obvious (e.g., const x = 5 infers number).
- Add explicit types for function parameters and public API surfaces.
- Avoid `any` type unless explicitly justified in a comment.
